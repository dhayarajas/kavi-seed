# LaTeX Paper Updates Summary

## ✅ Completed Updates

### 1. Figure References Updated

All figure paths have been updated to point to the `results/` directory, matching the outputs from the Jupyter notebook:

- **Architecture Diagram**: `figures/architecture.png` (user-provided)
- **Canopy Performance**: `results/canopy_performance.pdf`
- **Canopy Detection**: `results/canopy_detection.pdf`
- **Seed Health Results**: `results/seed_health_results.pdf`
- **ARS Temporal**: `results/ars_temporal.pdf`
- **Ablation Study**: `results/ablation_study.pdf`
- **Comparative Analysis Heatmap**: `results/comparative_analysis_heatmap.pdf`
- **Gaps Addressed**: `results/gaps_addressed.pdf`
- **Novel Contributions**: `results/novel_contributions.pdf`

### 2. Results from Notebook Integrated

All performance metrics match the CSV files generated by the notebook:

#### Canopy Stress Detection (Table 1)
- AIRS-GSeed: 89.2% accuracy, 0.87 F1, 0.93 AUC, 10.5 days lead time
- Matches: `results/canopy_performance.csv`

#### Pod-Zone Inference (Table 2)
- AIRS-GSeed (PINN): 6.2% VWC RMSE, 0.78 correlation
- Matches: `results/pod_zone_performance.csv`

#### SHI Prediction (Table 3)
- AIRS-GSeed: R² = 0.81, RMSE = 9.8, MAE = 7.2, Correlation = 0.86
- Matches: `results/shi_performance.csv`

#### ARS Prediction (Table 4)
- AIRS-GSeed: R² = 0.76, RMSE = 11.2, 16.3 days lead time, 82.4% accuracy
- Matches: `results/ars_performance.csv`

#### Ablation Study (Table 5)
- Pod-Zone Inference: -0.09 SHI, -0.07 ARS
- Hyperspectral Data: -0.15 SHI, -0.12 ARS
- Temporal Modeling: -0.06 SHI, -0.08 ARS
- Multi-Modal Fusion: -0.11 SHI, -0.09 ARS
