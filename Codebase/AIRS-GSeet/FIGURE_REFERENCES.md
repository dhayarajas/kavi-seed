# Figure References in LaTeX Paper

## Updated Figure Paths

All figures are now referenced from the `results/` directory, matching the outputs from the Jupyter notebook.

### Main Figures

1. **Architecture Diagram** (Fig. 1)
   - Path: `figures/architecture.png`
   - Source: User-provided image from `/Users/dhaya/Kavitha-Agri/Images/architecture.png`
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:architecture}`

2. **Canopy Performance** (Fig. 2)
   - Path: `results/canopy_performance.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 5
   - Shows: Accuracy comparison and lead time analysis
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:canopy_performance}`

3. **Canopy Detection Example** (Fig. 3)
   - Path: `results/canopy_detection.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook (if created)
   - Shows: RGB image, ground truth, prediction, attention map
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:canopy_detection}`

4. **Seed Health Results** (Fig. 4)
   - Path: `results/seed_health_results.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 7
   - Shows: SHI/ARS scatter plots and method comparisons
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:seed_health}`

5. **ARS Temporal** (Fig. 5)
   - Path: `results/ars_temporal.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 9
   - Shows: Field-to-storage risk trajectory and intervention effects
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:ars_temporal}`

6. **Ablation Study** (Fig. 6)
   - Path: `results/ablation_study.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 11
   - Shows: Component contribution analysis
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:ablation}`

### Comparative Analysis Figures

7. **Comparative Analysis Heatmap** (Fig. 7)
   - Path: `results/comparative_analysis_heatmap.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 17
   - Shows: Feature support matrix for all 10 papers
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:comparative_analysis}`
   - Note: Uses `figure*` environment for full width

8. **Gaps Addressed** (Fig. 8)
   - Path: `results/gaps_addressed.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 18
   - Shows: Number of papers addressing each gap
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:gaps_addressed}`

9. **Novel Contributions** (Fig. 9)
   - Path: `results/novel_contributions.pdf`
   - Generated by: Notebook Cell 19
   - Shows: Uniqueness scores for AIRS-GSeed contributions
   - Reference: `\ref{fig:novel_contributions}`

## Results Data Files

All performance metrics are stored in CSV files in `results/`:

- `canopy_performance.csv`: Canopy stress detection metrics
- `shi_performance.csv`: Seed Health Index results
- `ars_performance.csv`: Aflatoxin Risk Score results
- `pod_zone_performance.csv`: Pod-zone inference metrics
- `ablation_study.csv`: Ablation study results
- `comparative_analysis_summary.csv`: Comparative analysis summary

## Compilation Notes

1. Ensure all figure files exist in `results/` directory
2. The `\graphicspath` in paper.tex includes both `figures/` and `results/`
3. For IEEE format, figures should be in PDF format (PNG also works)
4. Full-width figures use `figure*` environment (spans both columns)

## Figure Generation

All figures can be regenerated by running the Jupyter notebook:
```python
# Run all cells in AIRS-GSeed_Results_Generation.ipynb
# This generates all PDF and PNG versions
```
